## The Slack Part
This is the part you would need to modify and integrate into your script.

Make a Slack bot and add it your workplace as normal. Copy your **bot token**. Don't forget to add file upload and chat write permissions to the bot!

Instructions here: [Slack API token](https://slack.com/help/articles/215770388-Create-and-regenerate-API-tokens) 

## Pre-install
- Connect your pwnagotch in MANUAL mode
- SSH to your pi (eg. ssh pi@pwnagotchi.local)
- Type: sudo su (to swith to root)
- Type: pip3 install slackclient

To do it's job pwnagotchi needs three parameters "token", "channel" and "title". You can define these in config.toml at any time.

## Install the plugin
- Use SCP to browse your pwnagotchi via WinSCP or other client you prefer
- Navigate to /usr/local/share/pwnagotchi/availaible-plugins/ on your pwnagotchi
- Paste slack.py and slack.yml into this directory
- Navigate to /etc/pwnagotchi/config.toml and check if entries exist:
-- main.plugins.slack.enabled = true
-- main.plugins.slack.token = "YOUR-BOT-TOKEN-HERE"
-- main.plugins.slack.channel = "YOUR-CHANNEL"
-- main.plugins.slack.title = "POST-TITLE"

If not add the to the main.plugins.slack.* list and fill in the defaults.

## How to 
Every time you enter manual mode (eg. after a session) and have internet your pwnagotchi will post the report as PNG file, but only if new handshakes arived.

Thats it, reboot or enable the slack plugin from plugins page to start :)
